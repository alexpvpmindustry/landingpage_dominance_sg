                <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                    As AI continues to transform industries, there is a growing need to equip the workforce with the skills required to thrive in an AI-driven economy. Singapore is addressing this challenge by integrating AI into its education system. The goal is to prepare students and professionals for the future, where AI will play a central role in many aspects of work and life.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                    AI-powered educational tools are being used to personalize learning experiences for students.

                <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                    While AI offers numerous benefits, its widespread adoption also raises important ethical considerations.
